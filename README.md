# FinalCSProject-2


Development Log:
In the beginning of the project (end of May/ early June), Michela put in a Location class and started on a Pellet class. Meanwhile Tara started researching the different movements of the ghosts in pacman as well as PacMan himself
Towards the middle they began to finalize the backend of the code. Tara worked on ghost algorithms and Michela worked on Location and Pellets properties such as isWall() and eatMe().
At the end they put all of their things into processing and worked together to make it look nice. This lead to a lot more commits for merging purposes.


Our PacMan uses the keys "wasd" to move and our ghosts aim to either a, catch pacman, or b, escape superPacMan.

Although the logic behing this works, we had lots of Null Pointer Exceptions due the code not find a negative row or column.
